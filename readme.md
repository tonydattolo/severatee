# SeveraTEE - ETH Global Trifecta 2025

## Overview

Core Sponsors: Privy,

SeveraTEE is a Severance show on AppleTv+ inspired project that uses AI agents, and TEEs to perform tasks. We have work that gets assigned, like Cold Harbor, and we have 'Innie' AI Agents that use Nillion SecretLLM to do "mysterious and important" work in a Trusted Execution Environment. The work is then stored in a Nillion SecretVault, and the task status is confirmed as completed. Additionally, we have a 'Kier' AI Agent that has access to custom Agentkit Action tools that can access our tasks, innies, and their outties wallets. We can ask it to assign work to the innies, and we can ask it to confirm that the work is done, and we can ask it to pay the innies. We are also using the new Privy Server Wallets to control both the Kier manager wallet, and the innies wallets, to automate wallet issuance for each agent, and transfer the funds from the Kier manager wallet to the innies wallets.
